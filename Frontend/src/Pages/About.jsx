      <h1>About The Digital Learning</h1>
      <p>
        We're on a mission to transform careers through quality education and

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          The Digital Learning was founded in 2013 by Dr. Aditya Sharma, a former Google Tech Lead who
          recognized the gap between university education and industry requirements. What started
          as a small training center with just two courses has now grown into a leading tech
          education institute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we've helped thousands of students transform their careers through our
          industry-aligned curriculum, hands-on projects, and robust placement support. Our success
          is measured by the success of our students, many of whom now work at top technology
          companies worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, The Digital Learning offers over 20 specialized courses across various tech domains,
          taught by experienced industry professionals who bring real-world insights into the
          classroom. We continue to evolve our teaching methodologies and course content to stay
          ahead of industry trends.
